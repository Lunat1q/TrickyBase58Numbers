The main point to make this script was an easy storage of small numbers (like pin-codes or similar).
So it's quite easy to use:

### [Github pages example](https://lunat1q.github.io/TrickyBase58Numbers/)

- Open the website
- Enter your code word `(aka password)`
- Enter the digit you want to encode to the top textbox, they are quite large in default layout to be used on the smartphone
- Click encode :)
- ???
- Profit.

Decode the same way:
- Open the website
- Enter the same code word you used to encode
- Enter your encoded string to the bottom textbox
- Click decode


The use-case of this for me:
For a creditcard, which i mostly pay wirelessly via NFC on the phone or on the internet, so i forget the pincodes :). Encode its pin like i've described above, and simply add this encoded string `(2 (max 3) letters for the 4pin digits)` right to the card with waterproof marker, and i'm good to go with pin stored right on the card, with no way someone to break or read it.
